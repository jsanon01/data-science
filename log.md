# Data Science

## Module 1

### What is Data Science?

- Data Science is a process not an event; a process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world.

- Data Science is when to translate data into a story to generate insights to make strategic choices.

- Simply said, Data Science is the study of data to find answers to questions that they are exploring.

- Data Science is relevant today because we have tons of data available: log files | email | social media | sales data | patient information files | sports performance data | sensor data | security cameras ...

### Fundamentals of Data Science

Most people agree that Data Science has a significant data analysis component.

What is new is the vast quantity of data available from massively varied sources.


Data Scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business. 

- Data Science is changing:
    - The way we work
    - The way we use data
    - The way organizations understand the world.

### The Many Paths to Data Science

Before Data Science, there was statistics. Data Science didn't exist until 2009 - 2011. Just to name a few areas:

- Business world | Mechanical & Civil Engineering

- Accounting, Economics & Finance

- Content moderator | Social Media

- Political science

- X-logy

=> Regardless of the path, Data Science is the lifeblood of the digital age.

### Advice to Data Science

- Straightforwardly, a data Scientist must be:
- Curious meaning to be able to take a position (to know what to do)
- Extremely argumentative (to the extent to plead a case)

- Judgmental (preconceived notions)

- Flexible with analytics platforms (software along with tabulations allowing to tell a great story)

### => In the past, one might say "I thought I believed this..."

### => After learning Data Science, one can say: "Now, I know this..."

### According to the industry, one might need different sets of skills (for competitive advantage = to exceed beyond others...)

### Data Science: The Sexiest Job in the 21st Century

Because the digital revolution has touched every aspect of our lives, the opportunity to benefit from learning about our behaviors is more so now than ever before. 

Simply said, data scientists have emerged as a hot commodity, in the data-driven world. 
- In 1995 the size of the digital universe was about 150 Billions Gigabytes ...

- In 2020, this number is about 40 Trillion Gigabytes...

- (In 2030, there will be around  40 sextillion bytes)

- It’s been estimated there will be 75 billion IoT devices by 2025, adding a few zeroes onto the size of the digital universe

## Module 2

### What Data Scientists Do?

#### A Day in the Life of Data Science

- I learned that in data science, you really have to look into every detail. Almost everything is involved and little details are very important. It's relevant that you are very observant.

- Data Science tells us that it is not enough to just work with the data we have, but to better understand the problem and find the solution, we must participate in the processes.


### Old Problems, New Problems, Data Science Solutions 

- Organizations can leverage the almost unlimited amount of data now available to them in a growing number of ways because of Data Science.

- The main reason that organizations use Data Science is to discover optimum solutions to existing problems.

### => Let’s take a look at three examples of data science providing innovative solutions for old problems.

- In transport, Uber collects real-time user data to discover how many drivers are available, if more are needed, and if they should allow a surge charge to attract more drivers.

- The Toronto Transportation Commission has made great strides in solving an old problem with traffic flows, restructuring those flows in and around the city (by focusing on peak hour clearances and identifying the most congested routes). Therefore, monthly hours lost for commuters due to traffic congestion dropped from 4.75 hrs. in 2010 to 3 hrs. in mid-2014. 

<!-- =================================
- In facing issues in our environment, data science can also play a proactive role. Freshwater lakes supply a variety of human and ecological needs, such as providing drinking water and producing food. ======================= -->


- In facing issues in our environment, a team of US scientists from research centers stretching from Maine to South Carolina
is developing and deploying high-tech tools to explore cyanobacteria in lakes across the east coast. The team is using robotic boats, buoys, and camera-equipped drones to measure physical, chemical, and biological data in lakes where cyanobacteria are detected, collecting large volumes of data related to the lakes and the development of the harmful blooms.

#### How do you get a better solution that is efficient?

To do so, you must: 

- Identify the problem and establish a clear understanding of it.

- Gather the data for analysis.

- Identify the right tools to use.

- Develop a data strategy.

- Case studies are also helpful in customizing a potential solution.

- Once these conditions exist and available data is extracted, you can develop a machine learning model.

### => Data Science & Algorithms

Some of the key concepts about Data Science are:

Regression | Data Visualization (with R) | Artificoal Neural Networks

Structured data (like rows & columns similar to MS Excel) | Unstructured data (mostly coming from web)

#### => Lot of times we take unstructured data, get some structure out of it and then analyze it.

#### What is regression?

Let me explain regression in the simplest possible terms.

- Firstly, we have a constant. If you have ever taken a cab ride, a taxi ride, you understand regression.

Here is how it works.

The moment you sit in a cab ride, in a cab, you see that there's a fixed amount there (meaning a flat rate). It says $2.50.
This is what you owe to the driver the moment you step into a cab. That's a constant.

- Regression tells you what the base fare is and what is the relationship between time and the fare you have paid, and the distance you have traveled and the fare you've paid.

 - Regression allows you to compute that constant that you didn't know. That it's $2.50, and it would compute the relationship between the fare and and the distance and the fare and the time.

 ### Cloud for Data Science

- One of the things Cloud is very useful for is that it allows multiple entities to work with same data at the same time. So you can be working with the same data that your colleagues in say, Germany, and another team in India, and another team in in Ghana. They are collectively working and they are able to do so because the information and the algorithms and the tools and the answers and the results-- whatever they needed-- is available at a central place called 'Cloud.'

- Some big tech companies offer cloud platforms allowing you to become familiar with cloud-based technologies in a pre-built environment. 

    - IBM offers the IBM Cloud, 

    - Amazon offers Amazon Web Services or AWS, 

    - And Google offers Google Cloud Platform.


 #### => The Cloud is not only accessible from everywhere but also available on all kind of devices.

 #### => IBM also provides skills, Network labs, or SN labs to learners where you have access to tools like Jupyter notebooks and Spark clusters so you can create your own data science project and develop solutions


### What Makes Someone a Data Scientist?

- I define data science as something that data scientists do.

- One of the key ingredients for a successful data scientist is a behavioral trait: curiosity. 

- In an interview With the New York Times, Dr. Rachel Schutt defined a data scientist as someone Who is:
    
    - part computer scientist, 
    
    - part software engineer, 
    
    - and part statistician (Miller, 2013). 

But that's the definition Of an average data scientist. The best, she contended, tend to be really
    
    - curious people, 

    - thinkers who ask good questions 
    
    - and are O.K. dealing with unstructured situations and trying to find structure in them.

#### => "Curiosity is equally important for data scientists as it is for journalists."
