# Data Science

## Module 1

### What is Data Science?

- Data Science is a process not an event; a process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world.

- Data Science is when to translate data into a story to generate insights to make strategic choices.

- Simply said, Data Science is the study of data to find answers to questions that they are exploring.

- Data Science is relevant today because we have tons of data available: log files | email | social media | sales data | patient information files | sports performance data | sensor data | security cameras ...

### Fundamentals of Data Science

Most people agree that Data Science has a significant data analysis component.

What is new is the vast quantity of data available from massively varied sources.


Data Scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business. 

- Data Science is changing:
    - The way we work
    - The way we use data
    - The way organizations understand the world.

### The Many Paths to Data Science

Before Data Science, there was statistics. Data Science didn't exist until 2009 - 2011. Just to name a few areas:

- Business world | Mechanical & Civil Engineering

- Accounting, Economics & Finance

- Content moderator | Social Media

- Political science

- X-logy

=> Regardless of the path, Data Science is the lifeblood of the digital age.

### Advice to Data Science

- Straightforwardly, a data Scientist must be:
- Curious meaning to be able to take a position (to know what to do)
- Extremely argumentative (to the extent to plead a case)

- Judgmental (preconceived notions)

- Flexible with analytics platforms (software along with tabulations allowing to tell a great story)

### => In the past, one might say "I thought I believed this..."

### => After learning Data Science, one can say: "Now, I know this..."

### According to the industry, one might need different sets of skills (for competitive advantage = to exceed beyond others...)

### Data Science: The Sexiest Job in the 21st Century

Because the digital revolution has touched every aspect of our lives, the opportunity to benefit from learning about our behaviors is more so now than ever before. 

Simply said, data scientists have emerged as a hot commodity, in the data-driven world. 
- In 1995 the size of the digital universe was about 150 Billions Gigabytes ...

- In 2020, this number is about 40 Trillion Gigabytes...

- (In 2030, there will be around  40 sextillion bytes)

- It’s been estimated there will be 75 billion IoT devices by 2025, adding a few zeroes onto the size of the digital universe

## Module 2

### What Data Scientists Do?

#### A Day in the Life of Data Science

- I learned that in data science, you really have to look into every detail. Almost everything is involved and little details are very important. It's relevant that you are very observant.

- Data Science tells us that it is not enough to just work with the data we have, but to better understand the problem and find the solution, we must participate in the processes.


### Old Problems, New Problems, Data Science Solutions 

- Organizations can leverage the almost unlimited amount of data now available to them in a growing number of ways because of Data Science.

- The main reason that organizations use Data Science is to discover optimum solutions to existing problems.

### => Let’s take a look at three examples of data science providing innovative solutions for old problems.

- In transport, Uber collects real-time user data to discover how many drivers are available, if more are needed, and if they should allow a surge charge to attract more drivers.

- The Toronto Transportation Commission has made great strides in solving an old problem with traffic flows, restructuring those flows in and around the city (by focusing on peak hour clearances and identifying the most congested routes). Therefore, monthly hours lost for commuters due to traffic congestion dropped from 4.75 hrs. in 2010 to 3 hrs. in mid-2014. 

<!-- =================================
- In facing issues in our environment, data science can also play a proactive role. Freshwater lakes supply a variety of human and ecological needs, such as providing drinking water and producing food. ======================= -->


- In facing issues in our environment, a team of US scientists from research centers stretching from Maine to South Carolina
is developing and deploying high-tech tools to explore cyanobacteria in lakes across the east coast. The team is using robotic boats, buoys, and camera-equipped drones to measure physical, chemical, and biological data in lakes where cyanobacteria are detected, collecting large volumes of data related to the lakes and the development of the harmful blooms.

#### How do you get a better solution that is efficient?

To do so, you must: 

- Identify the problem and establish a clear understanding of it.

- Gather the data for analysis.

- Identify the right tools to use.

- Develop a data strategy.

- Case studies are also helpful in customizing a potential solution.

- Once these conditions exist and available data is extracted, you can develop a machine learning model.

### Data Science & Algorithms

Some of the key concepts about Data Science are:

Regression | Data Visualization (with R) | Artificoal Neural Networks

Structured data (like rows & columns similar to MS Excel) | Unstructured data (mostly coming from web)

#### => Lot of times we take unstructured data, get some structure out of it and then analyze it.

#### What is regression?

Let me explain regression in the simplest possible terms.

- Firstly, we have a constant. If you have ever taken a cab ride, a taxi ride, you understand regression.

Here is how it works.

The moment you sit in a cab ride, in a cab, you see that there's a fixed amount there (meaning a flat rate). It says $2.50.
This is what you owe to the driver the moment you step into a cab. That's a constant.

- Regression tells you what the base fare is and what is the relationship between time and the fare you have paid, and the distance you have traveled and the fare you've paid.

 - Regression allows you to compute that constant that you didn't know. That it's $2.50, and it would compute the relationship between the fare and and the distance and the fare and the time.

 ### Cloud for Data Science

- One of the things Cloud is very useful for is that it allows multiple entities to work with same data at the same time. 

- Co-workers around the world are collectively able to do so because the information, algorithms, tools, answers and results [ whatever they needed ] are available at a central place called 'Cloud.'

- Some big tech companies offer cloud platforms allowing you to become familiar with cloud-based technologies in a pre-built environment. 

    - IBM offers the IBM Cloud, 

    - Amazon offers Amazon Web Services or AWS, 

    - And Google offers Google Cloud Platform.


 #### => The Cloud is not only accessible from everywhere but also available on all kind of devices.

 #### => IBM also provides skills, Network labs, or SN labs to learners where you have access to tools like Jupyter notebooks and Spark clusters so you can create your own data science project and develop solutions


### What Makes Someone a Data Scientist?

- I define data science as something that data scientists do.

- One of the key ingredients for a successful data scientist is a behavioral trait: curiosity. 

- In an interview With the New York Times, Dr. Rachel Schutt defined a data scientist as someone Who is:
    
 ####   - part computer scientist, 
    
 ####   - part software engineer, 
    
 ####   - and part statistician [ (Miller, 2013) ]. 

But that's the definition Of an average data scientist. The best, she contended, tend to be really
    
    - curious people, 

    - thinkers who ask good questions 
    
    - dealing with unstructured situations and trying to find structure in them.

#### => "Curiosity is equally important for data scientists as it is for journalists."


## Module 3

### Big Data & Data Mining

#### Foundations of Big Data

In this digital world, everyone leaves a trace. Either from social media, text and email messages, travel habits to our workouts and entertainment, the increasing number of internet connected devices that we interact with on a daily basis record vast amounts of data about us. Thus, there is even a name for it: 'Big Data'

There is no accurate definition of Big Data, however, there are certain elements that are common
across the different definitions, such as velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value.

### => They are referred to as 5 Vs.
![5 Vs](https://github.com/jsanon01/data-science/blob/main/images/5Vs.png)

- Velocity => is the speed (at which data accumulates). Such example is Cloud-based technology processing data in Real time streaming.
#### => Example:

Data is generated every 60 seconds (hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube)

- Volume => is the increase in the amount of data stored (dscale of ata).

#### => Example:  

The world population is approximately seven billion people and the vast majority are now using digital devices; mobile phones, desktop and laptop computers, wearable devices, and so on they use approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes every day... equivalent of 10 million Blu-ray DVD's.

- Variety => is the diversity of the data coming from different sources:
    - Structured data like rows & columns
    - Unstructured data like tweets, blog posts, pictures, numbers, videos ...

#### => Example:

 Different types of data such as: text, pictures, film, sound, health data from wearable devices, and many different types of data from devices connected to the Internet of Things.


- Veracity => is the quality and origin of data being accurate,

#### => Example:

 Because 80% of data is considered to be unstructured, we must devise ways to produce
reliable and accurate insights.

##### Data must be categorized, analyzed, and visualized.

- Value => is our ability and need to turn data into value (medical or social benefits, as well as customer, employee, or personal satisfaction.)


#### How Big Data is driving Digital Information?

Digital Transformation affects business operations around the world.

- Netflix moved from being a postal DVD lending system to one of the world’s foremost video streaming providers, 

- The Houston Rockets NBA team used data gathered by overhead cameras to analyze the most productive plays, 

#### => They use video tracking data to provide best opportunities for high scores.

- Lufthansa analyzed customer data to improve its service.


## Business Technology Analyst

### What is the role of a Business Technology Analyst?

- A BTA works on analysis and design in the areas of:
  planning | organization | Information Technology

- Technical Business Analyst is typically part of an IT organization.

- The business analyst must ensure that designs meet a company's technical standards.

There are 4 types of analysis

- Descriptive Analytics => dealing with reports and alerts

- Diagnostic Analytics => dealing with queries and data mining

- Predictive Analytics => dealing with forecasts and simulations

- Prescriptive Analytics => dealing with planning and optimization


#### - IoT devices 

    IoT devices are connected the Internet. These devices can perform:
    - remote sensing, 
    - actuating and monitoring. 

- IoT devices can exchange data with other connected devices and applications (directly or indirectly), or collect data from other devices and process the data either locally or send the data to centralized servers or cloud-based applications.

#### - Smart Roads 

   Smart Roads equipped with sensors can provide information on
    - driving conditions, travel time estimates and alerts in case of poor driving conditions, 
    - traffic congestions and accidents. 
Such information can help in making the roads safer and help in reducing traffic jams. Information sensed from the roads can be communicated via Internet to cloud-based big data analytics applications. The analysis results can be disseminated to the drivers who subscribe to such applications or through social media.

#### - Air Pollution Monitoring: 

Air pollution monitoring systems can monitor emission of harmful gases (CO2, CO, NO, or NO2) by factories and automobiles. 


#### - Logistics & Transportation

##### - Real-time Fleet Tracking: 
Vehicle fleet tracking systems use GPS technology to track the locations of the vehicles in real-time. Cloud-based fleet tracking systems can be scaled up on demand to handle large number of vehicles. Alerts can be generated in case of deviations in planned routes. Big data systems can be used to aggregate and analyze vehicle locations and routes data for detecting bottlenecks in the supply chain such as traffic congestions on routes, assignment and generation of alternative routes, and supply chain optimization.


#### - Remote Vehicle Diagnostics: 

Remote vehicle diagnostic systems can detect faults in the vehicles or warn of impending faults. These diagnostic systems use on-board devices for collecting data on vehicle operation (such as speed, engine RPM, coolant temperature, or fault code number) and status of various vehicle sub-systems.

#### - Route Generation & Scheduling: 

Modern transportation systems are driven by data collected from multiple sources which is processed to provide new services to the stakeholders. By collecting large amount of data from various sources and processing the data into useful information, data-driven transportation systems can provide new services such as advanced route guidance, dynamic vehicle routing, anticipating customer demands for pickup and delivery problem, for instance. 

#### - On-demand transport technology aggregators: 

  Cab/taxi aggregators allow customers to book cabs using web or mobile applications and the requests are routed to nearest available cabs (sometimes even private drivers who opt-in their own cars for hire). The cab aggregation platforms use big data systems for real-time processing of requests and dynamic pricing. These platforms maintain record of all cabs and match the trip requests from customers to the nearest and most suitable cabs. These platforms adopt dynamic pricing models where the pricing increases or decreases based on the demand and the traffic conditions.


### Suggestions for Self-Service Technology

- Portable kiosks inside the buses

- Portable kiosks at convenient stores 

- Gift or pre-paid cards (at grocerie stores)

![Portable iPad Kiosk](https://github.com/jsanon01/data-science/blob/main/images/iPad%20kiosk.png)

#### => Kiosks don't do cash transactions but relay information to a centralized server processing gifts and prepaid cards.

## What is Business Technology?

Business Technology as a concept describes all technology that helps an organisation run its business and operational processes. That technology can be: 

- customer-facing applications and solutions, 

- business-critical production and logistics solutions, 

- or back office financial systems, among others. 

Whatever its use, all this technology should be managed professionally.

### Elements of Business Technology

- Digital Frontline

Digitalisation provides new business opportunities and requires consistent design thinking on how to face customers, partners and employees in a networked multi-channel world.

##### Example:

Digital apps and web, as well as digital enterprises, enable the creation of new business possibilities around customer experience, digital business and internet of things (IoT) services.

#### => Customer experience is at the heart of all digital frontline activities.

- Technology Backbone

 It is where the essential business asset of a company resides, and the purpose is to provide operational efficiency to the company through reliability, security and scalability.

![Business Capabilities](https://github.com/jsanon01/data-science/blob/main/images/frontline.png)

### Technology Domain

We define four distinct categories of technology: 

- customer interfacing technology => 

is interaction with the customer facing processes and services

- product technology =>

that can be operated, monitored and/or interfaced remotely and can interact with its environment 24/7

- operational technology 

contains all information systems used for managing, operating and monitoring automation systems.

- and business process technology.

consists of information technology and solutions that are used for managing business processes and executing business transactions, i.e. systems that support day-to-day business operations.

<!--
### What is Hadoop?

Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes of data. 

Instead of using one large computer to store and process the data, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to analyze massive datasets in parallel more quickly.

#### => At the bottom of data science () you see probability and statistics. () You see algebra, linear algebra () you see programming () and you see databases.


### Data Science Skills and Big Data

Data Scientists lead to the following skills:

- To become a (self taught) programmer 
- To be familiar with economics & statistics
- To have basics Python (notebook)
- To be knowledgeable in RDBMS
- To learn Python Pandas (for math & statistical calculations

#### Data Scientists (at NYU)

Data science and business analytics have become very hot subjects in the last four or five years.

#### => My definition of Big Data is data that is large enough in terms of volume and velocity that not only you cannot handle it with traditional database systems but also  can't fit on a thumb drive.

Big Data started by Google when they want to figure out how to solve their page rank algorithm; and they ended up creating  clusters of higher-end hardware, which later on turned into Hadoop... 

### Data Mining

- Extracting data Mining Goals
- Selecting Data
- Processing Data
- Transforming Data
- Storing Data

## Module 4 

### Deep Learning and Machine Learning Objectives

#### What's the Difference?

There is some intersection between AI and Data Science, but one is not a subset of the other.

Rather, Data Science is a broad term that encompasses the entire data processing methodology.

While AI includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions.

#### => Both AI and Data Science can involve the use of big data, that is significantly large volumes of data.
