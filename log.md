### What is Data Science?

- Data Science is a process not an event; a process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world.

- Data Science is when to translate data into a story to generate insights to make strategic choices.

- Simply said, Data Science is the study of data to find answers to questions that they are exploring.

- Data Science is relevant today because we have tons of data available: log files | email | social media | sales data | patient information files | sports performance data | sensor data | security cameras ...

### Fundamentals of Data Science

Most people agree that Data Science has a significant data analysis component.

What is new is the vast quantity of data available from massively varied sources.


Data Scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business. 

- Data Science is changing:
    - The way we work
    - The way we use data
    - The way organizations understand the world.

### The Many Paths to Data Science

Before Data Science, there was statistics. Data Science didn't exist until 2009 - 2011.

- Business world | Mechanical & Civil Engineering

- Accounting, Economics & Finance

- Content moderator

- Political science

- X-logy

=> Regardless of the path, Data Science is the lifeblood of the digital age.

### Advice to Data Science

- Judgmental (preconceived notions)

### => After learning to Data Science, one can say: "Now, I know this..."

### According to the industry, one might need different sets of skills (for competitive advantage = to exceed beyond others...)

### Data Science: The Sexiest Job in the 21st Century

Because the digital revolution has touched every aspect of our lives, the opportunity to benefit from learning about our behaviors is more so now than ever before. 

Simply said, data scientists have emerged as a hot commodity, in the data-driven world. 
- In 1995 the size of the digital universe was about 150 Billions Gigabytes ...

- In 2020, this nuber is about 40 Trillion Gigabytes...

- (In 2030, there will be around  40 sextillion bytes)

- Itâ€™s been estimated there will be 75 billion IoT devices by 2025, adding a few zeroes onto the size of the digital universe
